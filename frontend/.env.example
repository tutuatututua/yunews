# Vite frontend environment variables
#
# Vite only exposes variables prefixed with VITE_ to the browser.
# Create a local file named `.env` in this same folder (frontend/) and set values here.
#
# Local dev (recommended): point directly at the backend API
VITE_BACKEND_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
#
# Production behind a reverse proxy (recommended):
# VITE_BACKEND_BASE_URL=/api
